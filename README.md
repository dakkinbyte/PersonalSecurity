A bunch of these places require you to enter your email to opt out, so use an email you don’t care about or just accept it’s better to give them your email address (which they probably already have) than have your home address and phone number online.

To find your profile to submit removal for, search for your name. It takes a while and seems like it's going to ask you for money but eventually it finishes and you can copy the URL to ask for a takedown
